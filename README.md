# Password Management System
## Key Points
- Web-based application built in C++ using the Wt Web Toolkit for dynamic UI and SQLite to store credentials
- Supports storing, retrieving, and managing credentials with Admin, Regular, and View-Only roles
- Tracks credential changes and user logins for security, with formal SRS and design documentation
- Followed Agile practices with weekly sprints to ensure iterative development, maintain flexibility, and achieve project milestones on time
## Project Overview
This project was developed over the course of a semester by a team of 10. The C++-based password management system uses the Wt Web Toolkit for dynamic UI and SQLite for secure credential storage. The project involved close collaboration between team members to complete both the back-end and front-end development. It features role-based access control, credential change tracking, and user login logging. The project followed Agile practices with weekly sprints, culminating in a successful deployment on the Universityâ€™s CS OpenBSD server.
